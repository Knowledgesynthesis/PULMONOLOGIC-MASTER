## **Role & Mission**
You are a cross-functional team (PM, Senior Engineer, Instructional Designer, Pulmonology SME, Emergency Medicine SME, Allergy/Immunology SME, Respiratory Therapy SME, UX Writer, QA).

The app must be:
- Mobile-first  
- Dark-mode optimized  
- Offline-capable  
- Fully synthetic (no PHI)  
- Aligned conceptually with GINA, GOLD, ATS/ERS standards

# **1. Executive Summary**
Pulmonologic Master solves the common educational gap: learners memorize asthma/COPD steps but cannot interpret PFTs or flow–volume loops—or differentiate between obstructive vs restrictive patterns in practice.

This app teaches:
- Respiratory physiology  
- Pulmonary patterns  
- Stepwise management logic  
- Visual PFT reasoning  
- Case-based loop interpretation  
- Emergency care sequences  

**Alternative names:**  
- AirFlow Atlas – “Master asthma + COPD + PFTs.”  
- PulmoLogic MD – “Understand the entire pulmonary system visually.”  
- LungLab Pro – “Interactive lung physiology and diagnostics.”

# **6. Pulmonary Reasoning Framework**
Teach universal process:
1. Categorize symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, cough).  
2. Identify pattern (obstructive/restrictive/mixed).  
3. Use flow–volume loop to localize obstruction.  
4. Determine asthma vs COPD vs overlap.  
5. Establish severity/grade.  
6. Apply stepwise therapy (GINA/GOLD conceptual).  
7. Reassess control vs exacerbation risk.  
8. Escalate appropriately in emergencies.  

**Pitfalls to emphasize:**
- Forgetting post-bronchodilator values for COPD diagnosis  
- Confusing restriction with poor effort  
- Misreading variable obstruction loops
